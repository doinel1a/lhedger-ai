# LHedgrer AI

üîç LHedgerAi is an AI-powered portfolio optimization platform that merges advanced mathematical analysis with an intuitive user experience ‚Äî helping crypto investors make safer, smarter decisions based on real data and statistical reasoning.

üß© The problem we solve is the poor risk management in crypto investing‚Äîmost users lack tools to assess how risky a specific coin is, leading to uninformed decisions and losses. Our platform helps users understand and manage risk through data-driven portfolio optimization and clear diversification strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Our project offers an AI-driven implementation of Markowitz's Efficient Frontier, enabling users to optimize their crypto portfolios by balancing risk and return through intelligent diversification. This makes advanced investment strategies accessible to everyday users in a simple, automated way.

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë The target audience are the crypto investors that lack either the experience to analyze the market or lack the time.

üåç Impact & Ecosystem Fit

We integrated Token Metrics as a source for general market data and used Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data to power our analytics dashboard. This dashboard displays key metrics such as daily volume (last 24h), price trends, and trading signals, helping users better understand market movements. Additionally, we used daily OHLCV data from the past year to compute the Markowitz Efficient Frontier chart, enabling data-driven risk-return analysis. Sentiment indicators were also incorporated to enhance the interpretation of trader signals.

We integrated the On-Chain Kit and successfully deployed the Bundler Smart Contract on Base [view on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/address/0x23b838A2b6B9158de82eb261a818D07EC5ab0624). All selected tokens are exclusively on the Base network, and we integrated with Uniswap pairs on Base to enable seamless trading and liquidity access.
